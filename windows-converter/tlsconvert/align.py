"""
Put two setups side by side, line them up by hand or by solver, and merge.

WHY BY HAND AS WELL AS AUTOMATICALLY. The solver is a search, and a search can
converge on a confident wrong answer -- this project has already had one, where
a rotation-only sweep returned a flat curve across a genuinely translated pair
and the flatness read as "these are already aligned". The eye catches that in a
second. So the operator gets the same transform the solver does, can drag it
themselves, and can see the residual move as they do; the button is a shortcut,
not an oracle.

⭐ THE CLOUDS ARE TINTED BY SCAN, and that is the default colour mode rather
than a novelty. Two greyscale clouds of the same room overlap into one greyscale
cloud, and the one thing alignment work needs to see is WHICH points came from
WHERE. Photo and height colouring are still there, but they are not what you
align by.

⭐ THE TRANSFORM LIVES IN THE VERTEX SHADER, so dragging a scan is free. Moving
the points on the CPU would mean re-encoding and re-uploading hundreds of
megabytes for every nudge; instead each cloud carries a model matrix and the GPU
applies it per frame.

⛔ THE CLIP BOX DISCARDS IN THE FRAGMENT STAGE. Squashing a clipped vertex in
the vertex shader (w = 0, or a position off in the distance) leaves a degenerate
primitive whose behaviour is driver-dependent, and on some cards it draws a
streak across the screen instead of nothing at all.

⭐ THE BOX IS DRAWN AS GEOMETRY, NOT AS AN OVERLAY, so it sits IN the scene and
an edge behind a wall is behind it. Its grips deliberately ignore depth: the box
exists to cut into a solid room, so the one thing that must never happen is a
handle buried in the wall it is there to cut through.

        ⚠ THIS THROWS THE PICTURE AWAY AND READS THE CAPTURES AGAIN, which costs
        the same half-minute the first load did. It is not a display filter: a

        Alignments and solver rungs are carried across, so the operator does not
        lose their placement to a change of detail.
